> This page is about [Squirtle Coloring](https://freecoloringpages.github.io/). Squirtle, known as the Tiny Turtle Pokemon, are cute-looking turtle Pokemon, capable of moving either on two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess a long, curled tail. When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their brown-orange shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it. If attacked anyway, their shells are resilient, and provide excellent protection. It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity. Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize resistance in water, enabling this Pokemon to swim at high speeds. The idea to feature Squirtle and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in Pokemon X and Y came about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokemon's final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokemon in order to see their Mega Evolved form.
